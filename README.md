# Simon Game

Simon is an electronic game of memory skill invented by **Ralph H. Baer** and **Howard J. Morrison**.

Simon Game were designed to always be harmonic, no matter the sequence. The notes, as of 2014, are as follows:
  - **G-note** (blue, lower right);
  - **C-note** (yellow, lower left);
  - **E-note** (red, upper right).
  - **G-note** (green, upper left, an octave higher than blue)

### How to play Simon Game?
- The swiping sounds are produced in a random order, along with the flash of the respective colors.
- The player has to remember the entire sequence from the start and has to visit the pattern at every turn, in the exact order, to receive the points.
- Even one wrong selection prompts the program to end the game.
